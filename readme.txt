This software is distributed for FREE; you can use and distribute it freely,
provided that you do not modify in any way the files included in the package.

I'm not responsible for any damage on your computer, but please let me know if
there are bugs or particular problems running one of the games.
Please let me know if there's something wrong, or if you like the games in the package,
or if you would like to change something... Thank you.

Some of the programs have been tested and played many times... but some of them
are new games that have been quickly tested only by me and my friends, so please
contact me and say what you think of them.
Some games have a simple Help or a Quick Help window, but many games have no help at all.
Sorry, but I have no time to write a real good help for each game - I concentrate on
writing the code for the games. 

The Collection includes games designed for Win32 systems (Windows 95/NT and more recent versions).
